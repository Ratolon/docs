Problem to solve: Human ion channel-like protein TACAN
======================================================

The transmembrane protein TMEM120A, also known as TACAN, forms an ion channel involved in adipocite differentiation and in sensing mechanical pain in animals and plants. 
The structure of the protein dimer has been recently modeled from cryo-EM data, bound and unbound to a small ligand, the fatty acid metabolism cofactor CoASH :cite:p:`rong2021`, :cite:p:`xue2021`. The homodimer was reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs and displays C2 symmetry. The soluble N-terminal domain of each monomer is located in the cytosolic side, and the transmembrane domain is embedded in the lipid bilayer. The CoASH cofactor occupies a small density in the intracellular funnel-like cavity of each monomer, although can be dissociated using a detergent solution. 




The volume, at XXXXXÅ resolution, and its atomic interpretation
(:numref:`model_building_example`) are available in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (*EMDB*) and Protein
Data Bank (*PDB*) with accession numbers *EMD-XXXX* and *PDB-XXXXX*, respectively.

This tutorial will guide us in the deduction process of the human *TACAN*
atomic structure using the *Scipion* framework, the 3D map and the protein
sequences as starting input data, as well as reference atomic
structures as homologous models in the way indicated in
:cite:t:`martinez2020`.
