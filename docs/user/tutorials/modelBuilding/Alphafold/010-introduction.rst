Introduction to Model building with Alphafold
=============================================

Model building is the process that allows getting the atomic
interpretation of an electron density map. Although an electron density volume can be obtained from different methodologies, in this tutorial we focus in maps obtained by cryo-EM.
AlphaFold algorithm performs predictions of protein structure using a deep learning system algorithm :cite:p:`alphafold`.

In this tutrial we will generate a model using alphafold, break it into domains, fit the domains in the 3D density map and finally fill in the missing parts.
