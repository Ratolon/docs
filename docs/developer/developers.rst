Welcome to the **Scipion Developers Page**!

On this page, you will find documentation about the Scipion architecture and how you can easily 
extend Scipion with new functionality. If you are completely new to the Scipion framework, we 
recommend that you start with our :ref:`Introduction to Scipion Developers <introduction-to-scipion-developers>`

General Information
-------------------
* :doc:`Architecture <architecture>`: take a look at the big picture
* :ref:`Scipion EM Classes <scipion-em-classes>`: Diagram containing EM Classes and its relations
* :ref:`Conventions <conventions>` : How scipion understands rotations, translations, symmetries ...
* :ref:`Release-notes <release-notes>`: What has been done in each release.
